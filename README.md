# SinGPT
This is the new webui for a tool of mine, called SinGPT. It's a strange, quirky model created by Pygmalion on HuggingFace[1].
It is based off of OogaBoogas' text generation webui. It is deployed to huggingface via an HF push tool I wrote. You can check it out in the main.yml file. If you fork this space, to continue deployed to Hugging Face, you **must** add a write access HuggingFace token to the repo secrets.
